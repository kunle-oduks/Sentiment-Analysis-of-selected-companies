# Sentiment Analysis of selected companies
The app is to present the current sentiment analysis on selected companies. The app scrapes live data (news) from a stock exchange site which is analyzed using nltk.vader. The sentiment analysis's result is plotted to show both time and daily trends.
The app is for academic purposes only and should not be used singularly in determining an investment decision.

Areas of improvement on the app will be to get data for more days and to actually superimpose the plot of price movements. This will show the effect of the sentiments on the stock price.
